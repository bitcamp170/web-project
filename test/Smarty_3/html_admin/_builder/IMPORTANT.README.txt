	----------------------------------------------------
	DO NOT USE THIS FOLDER!
	This will build the admin layouts, nothing else!
	----------------------------------------------------


	This is what it does:
		1. get the boilerplate of each layout from _partials
		2. replace '<!-- builder:content -->' tag with the content for each page from _partials/content/
		3. save as html page to its folder (exmaple: ../layout_1/index.html)
		4. copy assets (from the frontend '../../assets')


		-------------------------------------------------
		So, if you changed something in src/scss/_variables.scss
		you can rebuild all admin layouts by pointing your browser
		to builder.php - and will rebuild all admin layouts!

		- OR - simply copy/paste the assets/ folder from the frontend to each admin layout!
		-------------------------------------------------


	WHY THIS "TECHNIQUE"?
	Because is time consuming doing changes by hand! 
	This can also be achived with GULP! (in a future update)
