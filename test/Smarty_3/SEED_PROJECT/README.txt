FRESH PROJECT START! NO GULP NEEDED!
++++++++++++++++++++

In case you don't use GULP (or you don't want to),
here are the ready to start folders! Only an empty index.html added
and you can copy/paste any block/html from the demos.

++
Please move/copy the folder to your local webserver!
++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please don't forget: Javascript files (assets/js/) are using
DEBUG mode ON! You can sse everything in your browser console.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before uploading your finished project, replace them with the files
from dist/DEBUG_OFF. Of course, the website will work the same but 
in case you don't like that everybody to see what is under the hood... :)


Thank you,
Dorin Grigoras.
